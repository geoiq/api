title: Feature Aggregation
---

Using the Feature API it's possible to calculate roll-up statistics of features. Using the @group_by@ and @aggregates@ you can specify to summarize max,min,sum, or average values. If a @group_by@ is specified but no aggregates, then just a count is returned of the number of features in that group.

h3. group_by

The @group_by@ option groups features based on the value of the attribute specified. This ends up with summarized data, by default with a count and optionally with additional @aggregates@ as specified below.

<pre><code>curl http://geocommons.com/datasets/98696/features.json?group_by[]=sortable</code></pre>

h3. aggregates

The @aggregates@ option is an array of objects that contain both a @name@ and a @calc@. So for example: @aggregates[][name]=cost&aggregates[][calc]=average@. A request can have multiple aggregates.

The calc parameter can be any of:

* max - maximum value of all attribute features
* min - minimum value of all attribute features
* sum - summation of all values
* average - average of all values

*Example*

<pre><code>curl http://geocommons.com/datasets/98696/features.json?aggregates[][name]=int_col&aggregates[][calc]=sum&group_by[]=sortable</code></pre>
