At this time, the delete features endpoint requires a "resource identifier" that is not actually used. So you can put whatever value you want for this. The important aspect are the array of @ids@ that will be deleted. Currently these are a simple index into the feature array, starting at 0.

*Required Parameters:* 

|_. Parameter |_. Description |_. Example |
| ids | array of feature index identifiers. Starts at 0 | ids=0,5,99 |

*Optional Parameters*: (none)

*Example*: 

<pre><code>curl -X DELETE -u "user:pass" http://geocommons.com/datasets/98696/features/0.json?ids=0,5,59</code></pre>
