Adds one or more features to the dataset.

*Required Parameters:* (none)

*Optional Parameters*:

Creating a feature in GeoIQ depends on the format, or schema, of the dataset. The Features include any of the optional attributes that are in the dataset and additionally a Geometry that is formatted as GeoJSON.

|_. Parameter |_. Description |_. Example |
| _any attribute_ | any attribute value from the dataset schema | {title: "My new Feature"} |
| geometry | GeoJSON formatted geometry | {geometry: {type: "Point", coordinates: [-100, 80.3]}} |

Note that any attributes specified in the feature that are not defined for the dataset are ignored.

*Example*: 

Assuming you created an empty dataset as described under "Create an empty dataset with JSON":/api/datasets/dataset_create and given a JSON array of features in a file _features.json_:

<pre>[{"House Price": 550000, Address: "123 4th St, Arlington, VA 22201", geometry: {type: "Point", coordinates: [-100, 80]}},
  {"House Price": 850000, Address: "2200 Clarendon Blvd, Arlington, VA 22201", geometry: {type: "Point", coordinates: [-120, 62.4]}}]</pre>

You could then POST this to the endpoint:

<pre><code>curl -X POST -u "user:pass" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @features.json http://geocommons.com/datasets/98696/features.json</code></pre>
